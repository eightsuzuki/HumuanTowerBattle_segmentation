# HumuanTowerBattle segmentation U2-Net
Using U2-Net, we generate a segmentation mask to separate the character from the background and remove the backgrounds from images of humans. This is a game inspired by the animal tower battle created in our laboratory. Instead of animals, the player's character is depicted falling down.
